            "text_content": "Proprioceptors are nerves that send information about changes in the muscular and skeletal systems to the nervous system, which responds with signals to help control the speed, strength, and coordination of muscle contractions. When a muscle is stretched (lengthened), proprioceptors detect the amount and rate of the change in muscle length. The nerves send a signal to the spinal cord, which then sends a signal back to the muscle, triggering a muscle contraction that resists the change in muscle length. Another signal is sent to the opposing muscle (antagonist), causing it to relax and facilitate contraction of the stretched (agonist) muscle. These reflexes occur frequently in active muscles and allow for fine control of muscle length and movement. Muscle flexibility is linked to strength. Practicing lower-body eccentric exercise (lengthening contractions) increases strength and flexibility and might decrease the risk of lower-body muscle injury. Small movements that only slightly stimulate the nerves cause small reflex actions. Rapid, powerful, and sudden changes in muscle length strongly stimulate the nerve receptors and can cause large and powerful reflex muscle contractions. Thus, stretches that involve rapid, bouncy movements can be dangerous and cause injury. Each bounce causes a reflex contraction, which means a muscle might be stretching at the same time it is contracting. Performing a gradual stretch and then holding it allows the proprioceptors to adjust to the new muscle length and to reduce the signals sent to the spine, thereby allowing muscles to lengthen and, over time, improving flexibility. The stretching technique called proprioceptive neuro\u00ad muscular facilitation (PNF), described later, takes advantage of"

A damaged disk may bulge out between vertebrae and put pressure on a nerve root, which causes pain. Painful pressure on nerves can also occur if damage to a disk narrows the space between two vertebrae. With age, you lose fluid from the disks, making them more likely to bulge and put pressure on nerve roots. Depending on the amount of pressure on a nerve, symptoms may include numbness in the back, hip, leg, or foot; radiating pain; loss of muscle function; depressed reflexes; and muscle spasm. If the pressure is severe enough, loss of function can be permanent."

Genetic factors also affect the ease with which weight is gained as a result of overeating and where on the body extra weight is added. If both parents are obese, their children have an 80% risk of being obese; children with one obese parent face a 50% risk of becoming obese. In studies that compared adoptees and their biological parents, the weights of the adoptees were found to be more like those of the biological parents than the adoptive parents, suggesting a strong genetic link. Hereditary influences, however, must be balanced against the contribution of environmental factors. Not all children of obese parents become obese, and normal-weight parents can have overweight and obese children. Environmental factors like diet and exercise are probably responsible for such differences."

When the muscles and other tissues that support a joint are tight, the joint is subject to abnormal stresses that can cause joint deterioration. For example, tight thigh muscles cause excessive pressure on the kneecap, leading to pain in the knee joint. Poor joint flexibility can also cause abnormalities in joint lubrication, leading to deterioration of the sensitive cartilage cells lining the joint; pain and further joint injury can result. Improved flexibility can greatly improve your quality of life, particularly as you get older. People tend to exercise less as they age, leading to loss of joint mobility and increased incidence of joint pain. Aging also decreases the natural elasticity of muscles, tendons, and joints, resulting in stiffness. The problem is often compounded by arthritis (see the box \u201cDoes Physical Activity Increase or Decrease the Risk of Bone and Joint Disease?\u201d). Good joint flexibility may help prevent arthritis, and stretching"

There are two types of ischemic strokes: \u2022 A thrombotic stroke is caused by a blood clot that forms in a cerebral or carotid artery that has been narrowed or damaged by atherosclerosis. \u2022 An embolic stroke is caused by an embolus, a \u00adwandering blood clot that is carried in the bloodstream and may become wedged in a cerebral artery. A hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, spilling blood into the surrounding tissue. Cells normally nourished by the vessel are deprived of blood and cannot function. In addition, accumulated blood from the burst vessel may put pressure on surrounding brain tissue, causing damage and even death."

Nevertheless, these responses vary from person to person and from one situation to another. People\u2019s perceptions of potential stressors\u2014and their responses to them\u2014also vary greatly. You may feel confident about taking exams but nervous about talking to people you don\u2019t know, while your roommate may love challenging social situations but dread taking tests. Your cognitive appraisal of a potential stressor\u2014how you think about it\u2014strongly influences how you respond to it. Two factors that can reduce the magnitude of the stress response are successful prediction and the perception of control. For instance, receiving course syllabi at the beginning of the term allows you to predict the timing of major deadlines and exams. This gives you control over your study plans and can help reduce the stress caused by exams. The way we appraise potentially stressful situations is highly individual and strongly related to emotions. The facts of a \u00adsituation\u2014Who? What? Where? When?\u2014are typically evaluated in the same way by each person. However, different people can evaluate the potential personal outcomes of a situation very differently: What does this mean for me? Can I do anything about it? Will it get better or worse? If you think you can\u2019t cope with a situation, you may respond negatively and with an inappropriate stress response. On the other hand, if you approach a situation as a challenge you can manage, you are likely to have a more positive and appropriate response. A moderate level of stress, if handled appropriately, can actually promote optimal performance (Figure 10.2)."

The average age of onset is about 20 years. A bulimic person may rapidly consume thousands of calories by binge eating; during a binge, bulimics feel as though they have lost control and cannot stop or limit how much they eat. This is followed by an attempt to get rid of the food by purging, usually by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics. Some binge and purge only occasionally; others do so many times every day. Binges may be triggered by a major life change or other stressful event. Binge eating and purging may become a way of dealing with difficult feelings such as anger and disappointment."

For example, short-term inflammation triggers increased muscle protein synthesis, which promotes muscle fitness and recovery from exercise. Chronic inflammation, by contrast, is a prolonged, abnormal process that causes tissue breakdown and diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although exercise increases acute inflammation during and shortly after a workout, it reduces chronic levels of \u00adinflammation\u2014if the training program is not too severe. For example, practicing endurance training three to five days a week will reduce inflammation, particularly when accompanied by weight and fat loss. Training excessively, such as running a marathon several times a month or doing severe cross-training workouts five to seven days per week, will cause overtraining and chronic inflammation. We could call this the Goldilocks effect: The training program should not be too much or too little; it should be just right."

Specific guidelines for heart health include the following: \u2022 Fats:\u00a0Saturated fats should be limited to 7% of total daily calories, or 5\u20136% for adults who have elevated LDL. Trans fats should be avoided. The majority of fats in your diet should be unsaturated, from sources such as vegetable oils, fish, and nuts. \u2022 Fiber: Studies have shown that a high-fiber diet is \u00adassociated with a 40\u201350% reduction in the risk of heart attack and stroke. To get the recommended 25\u201338 grams of dietary fiber a day, eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Good sources of fiber include oatmeal, some breakfast cereals, barley, legumes, and most fruits and vegetables. \u2022 Sodium and potassium: Reducing sodium intake to \u00adrecommended levels, while also increasing potassium intake, can help reduce blood pressure for many people. Limit sodium intake to no more than 2,300 mg/day for all Americans. Reducing sodium intake further, to 1,500 mg/day, is associated with even greater reductions in blood pressure. \u2022 Alcohol: Moderate alcohol use may increase HDL \u00adcholesterol; it may also reduce stroke risk, possibly by dampening the inflammatory response or by affecting blood clotting. For most people under age 45, however, the risks of alcohol use probably outweigh any health benefit. Excessive alcohol consumption increases the risk of a variety of serious health problems, including hypertension, stroke, some cancers, liver disease, alcohol dependence, and injuries."

For all people to receive adequate nutrition, the makeup of the world\u2019s diet may also need to change. A current controversy is the use of \u201cgolden rice,\u201d a crop genetically modified to contain vitamin A and provide extra nutrition to economically emerging countries. Although many people oppose the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), others believe that GMOs can help solve the food crisis. \u2022 Available land and water: Rural populations rely on local trees, soil, and water for their direct sustenance, and a growing population puts a strain on these resources. Forests are cut for wood, soil is depleted, and water is withdrawn at ever-increasing rates. These trends contribute to local hardships and to many global environmental problems, including habitat destruction and species extinction. \u2022 Energy: Currently, most of the world\u2019s energy comes from nonrenewable sources: oil, coal, natural gas, and nuclear power. As these sources are depleted, the world will have to shift to renewable (sustainable) energy sources, such as hydropower and solar, geothermal, wind, biomass, and ocean power.

As shown in Figure 9.2, resting metabolism (RMR) accounts for about 65\u201370% of daily energy expenditure. The energy required to digest food accounts for up to an additional 10% of daily energy expenditure. The remaining 20\u201330% is expended during physical activity. Both genetics and behavior affect metabolic rate. Men, who have a higher proportion of muscle mass than women, have a higher RMR because muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat, requiring more energy to support its activities. Also, some individuals inherit a higher or lower RMR than others; RMR may vary by as much as 25% among same-weight individuals. A higher RMR means that a person burns more calories while at rest and can therefore take in more calories without gaining weight. A number of factors reduce metabolic rate, making weight management challenging. Low-calorie intake and weight loss reduce RMR. When energy intake declines and weight is lost, the body responds by trying to conserve energy, reducing both RMR and the energy required to perform physical tasks. In essence, the body \u201cdefends\u201d the original starting weight. Consider two people of the same size and activity level who both currently weigh 150 pounds, but one of whom used to weigh 170 pounds; the individual who lost weight will need to consume fewer calories to maintain the 150-pound weight than the person who had always been at that weight. This physiological response of the body points to the importance of preventing weight gain in the first place."

There are two types\u2014Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). NHL is the more common and more deadly form of the disease. Risk factors for NHL are not well understood but may include genetic factors, \u00adradiation, and certain chemicals and infections."

Slow dynamic stretches can lengthen the muscles in many directions without developing high tension in the tissues. These stretches elongate the tissues and train the neuromuscular system. Because dynamic stretches are based on sports movements or movements used in daily life, they develop functional flexibility that translates well into activities. Dynamic stretches are more challenging than static stretches because they require balance and coordination and may carry a greater risk of muscle soreness and injury. People just beginning a flexibility program might want to start off with static stretches and try dynamic stretches only after they are comfortable with static stretching and have improved their flexibility. It is also a good idea to seek expert advice on dynamic stretching technique and program development."

Uncontrolled eating is usually followed by weight gain and feelings of guilt, shame, and depression. Many people with binge-eating disorder mistakenly see rigid dieting as the only solution to their problem, but this usually causes feelings of deprivation and a return to overeating. Compulsive overeaters rarely eat because of hunger. Instead, they use food to cope with stress, conflict, and other difficult emotions or to provide solace or entertainment. Binge eaters are"

During heavy exercise, such as sprinting, large increases in hydrogen and potassium ions cause muscles to fatigue rapidly. The anaerobic energy system also creates metabolic acids. Fortunately, exercise training increases the body\u2019s ability to cope with metabolic acids. Improved fitness allows you to exercise at higher intensities before the abrupt buildup of metabolic acids\u2014a point that scientists call the lactate threshold.

Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have increased rapidly in recent decades and, for the first time in recorded history, exceeded 400 parts per million in 2015. The use of fossil fuels pumps more than 20 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere every year. Experts believe CO2 may account for about 60% of the greenhouse effect. Analysis of ice core samples shows that CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide levels are now higher than at any time in at least the past 800,000 years. The United States is responsible for one-third of the world\u2019s total emissions of CO2. Deforestation, often by burning, also releases CO2 into the atmosphere and reduces the number of trees available to convert CO2 into oxygen. The year 2016 was the warmest since recordkeeping began in 1880. The global temperature has risen by about 2.0\u00b0F since the late 19th century. Most scientists agree that temperatures will continue to rise, although estimates vary as to how much they will change. If global warming persists, experts say the impact may be devastating (Figure 15.2). Possible consequences include the following: \u2022 Increased rainfall and flooding in some regions, increased drought in others. Coastal zones, where half the world\u2019s people live, would be severely affected. \u2022 Increased mortality from heat stress, urban air pollution, and tropical diseases.

Formally described as eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), OSFED is a feeding or eating disorder that does not meet full diagnostic criteria for anorexia, bulimia, or bingeeating disorder. Examples of OSFED include atypical anorexia nervosa, a condition in which weight is not below normal; bulimia nervosa, a condition with less frequent bulimic episodes; purging disorder, a condition without binge eating; and night eating syndrome, in which the individual engages in excessive nighttime food consumption. Ideally, our relationship to food should be a happy one. The biological urge to satisfy hunger is one of our most basic drives, and eating is associated with many pleasurable sensations. For some of us, food triggers pleasant memories of good times, family, holidays, and fun. But for too many people, food is a source of anguish rather than pleasure. In the lives of affected individuals, eating results in feelings of guilt and self-loathing rather than satisfaction, causing tremendous disruption. How do you know if you have disordered eating habits (for example, skipping meals or avoiding vegetables) that can lead to the more serious eating disorder? When thoughts about weight and food dominate your life, you have a problem. If you\u2019re convinced that your worth as a person hinges on how you look and how much you weigh, it\u2019s time to get help. Selfinduced vomiting or laxative use after meals, even if only once in a while, is reason for concern. Do you feel compelled to exercise excessively to compensate for what you\u2019ve eaten?

You may be familiar with the sensation of jet lag\u2014when a change of time zone causes the internal body clock to be out of sync with the new environment\u2014but travel between time zones is not the only disrupter of circadian rhythm. Some people have habits that cause their internal body clocks to be set at a time that differs from the time zone where they live. An example is a person who stays up regularly until four in the morning and then sleeps until noon, a pattern called delayed sleep phase. If this person occasionally has to wake up earlier, the change can be difficult, and the person will feel poorly, just like a person with jet lag."

In isometrics, the muscle contracts, but there is no movement. To perform an isometric exercise, a person can use an immovable object like a wall to provide resistance, or simply tighten a muscle while remaining still (e.g., tightening the abdominal muscles while sitting at a desk). The spine extension and the side bridge, shown in Exercises 5 and 6 (later in the chapter), are both isometric exercises. Static exercises are particularly important for developing stiff core or torso muscles that support the spine and provide a firm foundation for whole body motions. During almost all movements some muscles contract statically to support the skeleton so other muscles can contract dynamically. For example, when you throw something, hit a ball, or ski, the core muscles in the abdomen and back stabilize the spine. This stability allows more powerful contractions in the lower- and upper-body muscles. The core muscles also contract statically during dynamic exercises, such as squats, lunges, and overhead presses. Static exercises are useful in strengthening muscles after an injury or surgery, when movement of the affected joint could delay healing. Isometrics are also used to overcome weak points in an individual\u2019s range of motion. Statically strengthening a muscle at its weakest point will allow more weight to be lifted with that muscle during dynamic exercise."

            "text_content": "As we saw in Chapter 2, it\u2019s important to warm up before every session of cardiorespiratory endurance exercise and to cool down afterward. Because the body\u2019s muscles work better when their temperature is slightly above resting level, warming up enhances performance and decreases the chance of injury. It gives the body time to redirect blood to active muscles and the heart time to adapt to increased demands. Warming up also helps spread protective fluid throughout the joints, preventing injury to their surfaces. A warm-up session should include low-intensity, wholebody movements similar to those in the activity that will follow, such as walking slowly before beginning a brisk walk. An active warm-up of 5\u201310 minutes is adequate for most types of exercise. However, warm-up time will depend on your level of fitness, experience, and individual preferences. What about stretching as part of a warm-up? Performing static stretches\u2014those in which you move a joint to the end of the range of motion and hold the position\u2014as part of your pre-exercise warm-up has not been found to prevent injury and has little or no effect on post-exercise muscle soreness. Static stretching before exercise may also adversely affect strength, power, balance, reaction time, and movement time. (Stretching may interfere with muscle and joint receptors that are used in the performance of sport and movement skills.) For these reasons, it is often recommended that static stretches be performed at the end of your workout, after your cool-down but while your muscles are still warm and your joints are lubricated. On the flip side, dynamic stretches\u2014those involving continuous movement of joints through a range of motion\u2014can be an appropriate part of a warm-up. Slow and controlled movements such as walking lunges, heel kicks, and arm circles can raise muscle temperature while moving joints through their range of motion. (See Chapter 5 for a detailed discussion of stretching and flexibility exercises.) Cooling down after exercise is important for returning the body to a nonexercising state."

During times of stress, in fact, many people initially turn to their friends for comfort, rather than family members or lovers. Intimate love relationships are among the most profound human experiences. When two people fall in love, their relationship at first is likely to be characterized by high levels of passion and rapidly increasing intimacy. In time, passion decreases as the partners become more familiar. The diminishing passion can create stress (usually affecting one partner more than the other) and can be experienced as a crisis in the relationship.

You can measure your heart rate\u2014the number of heart contractions per minute\u2014by using a heart rate monitor or counting your pulse beats. Modern heart rate monitors are inexpensive and fairly accurate. Several companies make heart rate monitor apps that are used with smartphones to measure heart rate, distances, route maps, running or cycling speed, calories burned, and even\u00a0the electrical activity of the heart as it beats, which is what an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG) does. Counting your pulse is the traditional method of measuring heart rate. Each contraction of the heart produces a surge of blood that causes a pulse you can feel by holding your fingers against an artery. Heart rate is a good way to monitor exercise intensity during a workout. (Intensity is described in more detail in the next section.) The radial artery in the wrist is the most common site to measure pulse rate (Figure 3.5). To take your pulse, press your index and middle fingers gently on the correct site. You may have to shift position several times to find the best place to feel your pulse. A good technique is to bend your fingers slightly and take your pulse with the tops of your fingers where you have many nerve endings. Don\u2019t use your thumb to check your pulse; it has a pulse of its own that can confuse your count. Heart rates are usually assessed in beats per minute (bpm). But counting your pulse for an entire minute isn\u2019t practical when you\u2019re exercising. And because heart rate slows rapidly when you stop exercising, a full minute\u2019s worth of counting can give inaccurate results. It\u2019s best to do a shorter count\u201415"

Many people wrongly assume that they are unlikely to pick up an STI if they limit their sexual activity to oral sex, but this is not true, particularly in the case of genital herpes. HSV can also cause rectal lesions, usually transmitted through anal sex. Infection with HSV is generally lifelong; after infection, the virus lies dormant in nerve cells and can reactivate at any time. HSV 1 infection is so common that 50\u201380% of adults have antibodies to HSV 1 (indicating previous exposure to the virus). Most people are exposed to HSV 1 during childhood. HSV 2 infection usually occurs during adolescence and early adulthood, most commonly between ages 18 and 25. About 16% of adults have antibodies to HSV 2. HSV 2 is almost always sexually transmitted, including during oral sex. The infection spreads readily whether people have active sores or are completely asymptomatic. If you have ever had an outbreak of genital herpes (that is, the appearance of genital sores), you should consider yourself always contagious and inform your partners.

However, despite all the built-in safeguards and regulating agencies, accidents in nuclear power plants do happen, many due to human error (as at Three Mile Island in the United States and Tokaimura in Japan), and the consequences of such accidents are far more serious than those of similar accidents in other types of power-generating plants.

The chancre is usually found at the site where the organism entered the body, such as the genital area, but it may also appear in other sites such as the mouth, breasts, or fingers. Chancres contain large numbers of bacteria and make the disease highly contagious when present; they are often painless and typically heal on their own within a few weeks. If the disease is not treated during the primary stage, about a third of infected individuals progress to chronic stages of infection. Secondary syphilis is usually marked by mild, flu-like symptoms and a skin rash that appears three to six weeks after the chancre. The rash may cover the entire body or only a few areas, but the palms of the hands and soles of the feet are usually involved. Areas of skin affected by the rash are highly contagious but usually heal within several weeks or months. If the disease remains untreated, the symptoms of secondary syphilis may recur over a period of several years. Affected individuals may then lapse into an asymptomatic latent stage in which they experience no further consequences of infection. However, in about 15% of cases of untreated syphilis, the individual develops late, or tertiary syphilis, with symptoms that can appear 10\u201320 years after infection. Late syphilis can damage many organs of the body (brain, nerves, eyes, heart, blood vessels, liver, bones, and joints), possibly causing severe dementia, cardiovascular damage, blindness, and death."

To start, choose a weight that you can move easily through 8\u201312 repetitions, do only one set of each exercise, and rest 1\u20132 minutes between exercises. Gradually add weight and (if you want) sets to your program over the first few weeks until you are doing one to three sets of 8\u201312 repetitions of each exercise. If adding weight means you can do only 7 or 8 repetitions, stay with that weight until you can again complete 12 repetitions per set. If you can do only 4\u20136 repetitions after adding weight, or if you can\u2019t maintain good form, you\u2019ve added too much and should take some off. You can add more resistance in large-muscle exercises, such as squats and bench presses, than you can in small-muscle exercises, such as curls. For example, when you can complete 12 repetitions of squats with good form, you may be able to add 10\u201320 pounds of additional resistance; for curls, by contrast, you might add only 3\u20135 pounds.

Poor performance on the spinal endurance labs means that you are not training your abdominal muscles correctly."

In general, lifestyle should be your focus\u2014regular physical activity, endurance exercise, strength training, and a moderate energy intake. Making significant cuts in food intake in order to lose weight and body fat is a difficult strategy to maintain; focusing on increased physical activity is a better approach for many people. In studies of people who have lost weight and maintained the loss, physical activity was the key to long-term success. But even in the absence of significant changes in body composition, an active lifestyle improves wellness and decreases the risk of \u00addisease and premature death; see the box \u201cWhy Is Physical Activity Important Even If Body Composition Doesn\u2019t Change?\u201d You can track your progress toward your target body composition by checking your body weight regularly. Also, focus on how much energy you have and how your clothes fit. To get a more accurate idea of your progress, reassess your body composition occasionally during your program: Body composition changes as weight changes, although body composition can change even if your weight remains the same. If you lose a significant amount of weight, you will usually lose both body fat and some muscle weight because muscles don\u2019t have to work as hard to move a lighter body. However, the decline in weight will favor fat loss, and the proportion of body fat will decline, meaning an improvement in body composition."

Testicular cancer is much more common among white Americans than among Latinos, Asian Americans, or African Americans. Men with undescended testicles are at increased risk for testicular cancer, and for this reason the condition should be corrected in early childhood. Self-examination may help in the early detection of testicular cancer (see the box \u201cTesticle Self-Examination\u201d). Tumors are treated by surgical removal of the testicle and, if the tumor has spread, by chemotherapy. The five-year survival rate is 97%."

Patients with poor cardiorespiratory fitness prior to surgery experience more postoperative complications, including stroke, kidney failure, and even death, than patients with higher fitness levels. Bariatric surgery modifies the gastrointestinal tract. One method partitions the stomach with staples or a band, while another modifies the way the stomach drains (gastric bypass). The goal is to promote weight loss by reducing the amount of food the patient can eat. Potential complications from surgery include nutritional deficiencies, fat intolerance, nausea, vomiting, and reflux. As many as 10\u201320% of patients may require follow-up surgery to address complications."

Scientists also recognized that pathogens (microorganisms that can produce diseases) could be transmitted in sewage, drinking water, and food. These discoveries led to systematic garbage collection, sewage treatment, filtration and chlorination of drinking water, food inspection, and the establishment of public health enforcement agencies. These efforts to control and prevent communicable diseases changed the health profile of the industrialized world. Americans rarely contract cholera, typhoid fever, plague, diphtheria, or other diseases that once killed large numbers of people, but these diseases have yet to be eradicated worldwide. Every time we venture beyond the boundaries of our everyday world, whether traveling to a poorer country or camping in the wilderness, we are reminded of the importance of these basics: clean water, sanitary waste disposal, safe food, and insect and rodent control."

When glucose is in the bloodstream, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin, which allows cells to take up glucose and use it for energy and fat storage. The liver and muscles also take up glucose and store it in the form of a starch called glycogen. The muscles use glucose from glycogen as fuel during endurance events or long workouts.\u00a0Some people have problems controlling their blood glucose levels, a disorder called diabetes mellitus."

It is the fastest-growing alternative fuel in the United States, is biodegradable, and produces lower levels of most air pollutants than petroleum-based products. Biodiesel, like ethanol, can be problematic depending on its material source. The plants used to make it, such as soybeans and palm oil trees, absorb carbon dioxide as they grow, which can offset the carbon dioxide produced while making and using biodiesel. In such cases, the biodiesel is carbon neutral. Most of the biodiesel used in the United States is made from soybean oil that is a by-product of processing soybeans for animal feed and numerous other food and nonfood products, and from waste animal fat and grease. But in some parts of the world, natural vegetation and forests have been cleared and burned to grow soybeans and palm oil trees to make biodiesel, and these negative environmental and social effects can outweigh any benefit."

Since 1999, the amount of \u00adopioids prescribed has nearly quadrupled. By 2013, enough opioids were prescribed for every American adult to have a \u00adbottle of pills. Greater exposure led to an increase in the number of people addicted to opioids and to more drug overdose deaths. Changes made in response to the epidemic, including greater controls on prescription practices, appear to have prompted people with opioid addiction to switch to heroin and synthetic opioids like fentanyl. (Fentanyl is a prescription opioid similar to morphine but up to 100 times more powerful; illegally made fentanyl may be mixed with heroin.) Sold on the street, heroin and fentanyl are often less expensive and more easily obtained than prescription opioids, but they are even more dangerous."

Characteristic symptoms develop if an essential mineral is consumed in a quantity too small or too large for good health. For example, most Americans consume the mineral sodium in excess as part of dietary salt. The majority of sodium Americans consume comes from processed foods and restaurant meals. High sodium consumption raises blood pressure, and thus the risk for heart disease and stroke; reducing dietary salt has become an important public health initiative. The good news is that blood pressure begins to decrease within weeks of lowering sodium intake.\u00a0 Minerals commonly lacking in the American diet include iron, calcium, magnesium, and potassium. Low potassium intake is considered a public health concern because it is linked to high blood pressure and heart disease; you can improve your potassium intake by choosing a dietary pattern rich in fruits, vegetables, and legumes.

When a muscle is stretched, the wavelike elastin fibers straighten; when the stretch is relieved, they rapidly snap back to their resting position. This temporary lengthening is called elastic elongation. If stretched gently and regularly, connective tissues may lengthen and flexibility may improve. This longterm lengthening is called plastic elongation. Without regular stretching, the process reverses: These tissues shorten, resulting in decreased flexibility. Regular stretching may contribute to flexibility by lengthening muscle fibers through the addition of contractile units called sarcomeres. A muscle can tolerate a limited amount of stretch. As the \u00adlimits of its flexibility are reached, connective tissue becomes more brittle and may rupture if overstretched. A safe and effective program stretches muscles enough to slightly elongate the tissues but not so much that they are damaged. Research has shown that flexibility is improved best by stretching when muscles are warm (following exercise or the application of heat) and the stretch is applied gradually and conservatively. Sudden, highstress stretching is less effective and can lead to muscle damage."

One study found that exercise in polluted air could decrease lung function to the same extent as heavy smoking. Another study found that training in a polluted environment counteracted the normally beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. Symptoms of exercising in poor air quality include eye and throat irritations, difficulty breathing, and possibly headache and malaise.

It can be used to work the entire body, but it is particularly effective for working the core stabilizing muscles in the abdomen, chest, and back\u2014 muscles that are important for preventing back problems. The ball\u2019s instability forces the exerciser to use the stability muscles to balance the body, even when just sitting on the ball. The \u201cstir-the-pot\u201d exercise\u2014a plank position with elbows resting on the ball, which is then moved in small circles\u2014is an example of a core-building exercise that uses the stability ball. You can incorporate a stability ball into a typical workout in many ways. For example, you can perform curl-ups while lying on a ball instead of on the floor. Lying facedown across a ball provides different leverage points for push-ups. A variety of resistance training exercises can be performed on a stability ball, but experts recommend using dumbbells rather than barbells when lifting weights on a ball. When selecting a ball, make sure your thighs are parallel to the ground when you sit on it; if you are a beginner or have back problems, choose a larger ball so that your thighs are at an angle, with hips higher than knees. Beginners should use caution until they feel comfortable with the movements and take care to avoid poor form due to fatigue (Table 4.2)."

For example, touching the toes repeatedly in rapid succession is a ballistic stretch for the hamstrings. A problem with this technique is that the heightened activity of proprioceptors caused by the rapid stretches can continue for some time, possibly causing injuries during any physical activities that follow. Another concern is that triggering strong responses from the nerves can cause a reflex muscle contraction that makes it harder to stretch. For these reasons, ballistic stretching is usually not recommended, especially for people of average fitness. Ballistic stretching trains the muscle dynamically, so it can be an appropriate stretching technique for some well-trained athletes. For example, tennis players stretch their hamstrings and quadriceps ballistically when they lunge for a ball during a tennis match. Because this movement is part of their sport, they might benefit from ballistic training of these muscle groups."

These forms of radiation do have effects on health, but research results are inconclusive. Another controversial issue today is the effect of radiation from cell phones on health. Cell phones use electromagnetic waves (radio frequency radiation) to send and receive signals. This radiation is not directional, meaning that it travels in all directions equally, including toward the user. Factors such as the type of digital signal coding in the network, the antenna and handset design, and the position of the phone relative to the head all determine how much radiation is absorbed by a user. Specific absorption rate (SAR) is a way of measuring the quantity of radio frequency energy that is absorbed by the body. If you\u2019re concerned about limiting your exposure to possible radiation from your cell phone, look for a phone with a low SAR (some municipalities require phone manufacturers to provide this information on packaging). You can also text instead of calling, use a wired headset or speakerphone whenever possible, and carry your phone at least one inch from your body. Studies to date have not provided conclusive evidence that cell phone use actually exposes users to harmful levels of radiation."

The amount of overload needed to maintain or improve a particular level of fitness for a particular fitness component is determined through six dimensions, represented by the acronym FITT-VP: \u2022 Frequency\u2014how often \u2022 Intensity\u2014how hard or how fast \u2022 Time\u2014how long (duration) \u2022 Type\u2014mode of activity \u2022 Volume\u2014how much (frequency \u00d7 intensity \u00d7 time) \u2022 Progression\u2014how a program advances over time"

Identify resources that can help you. For example, you can join a community walking club or sign up for a smoking cessation program. You may also need to buy some new running shoes or nicotine replacement patches. Get the items you need right away; waiting can delay your progress. \u2022 Modify your environment. If you have cues in your environment that trigger your target behavior, try to control them. For example, if you normally have alcohol at home, getting rid of it can help prevent you from indulging. If you usually study with a group of friends in an environment that allows smoking, move to a nonsmoking area. If you always buy a snack at a certain vending machine, change your route to avoid it. \u2022 Control related habits. You may have habits that contribute to your target behavior; modifying these habits can help change the behavior. For example, if you usually plop down on the sofa while watching TV, try putting an exercise bike in front of the set that so you can burn calories while watching your favorite programs. \u2022 Reward yourself. Giving yourself instant, real rewards for good behavior will reinforce your efforts. Plan your rewards; decide in advance what each one will be and how you will earn it. Tie rewards to achieving specific goals or subgoals. For example, you might treat yourself to a movie after a week of avoiding snacks. Make a list of items or events to use as rewards. They should be special to you and preferably unrelated to food or alcohol. \u2022 Involve the people around you. Ask family and friends to help you with your plan.

Since the mid-1980s, scientists have observed the seasonal appearance and growth of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica. More recently, thinning over other areas has been noted. The ozone layer is being destroyed primarily by \u00adchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), industrial chemicals used as coolants in refrigerators and air conditioners, as foaming agents in some rigid foam products, as propellants in some kinds of aerosol sprays (most of which were banned in 1978), and as solvents. When CFCs rise into the atmosphere, winds carry them toward the polar regions. During winter, circular winds form a vortex that keeps the air over Antarctica from mixing with air from elsewhere. CFCs react with airborne ice crystals, releasing chlorine atoms, which destroy ozone. When the polar vortex weakens in the summer, winds richer in ozone from the north replenish the lost Antarctic ozone. The largest and deepest ozone hole, recorded in 2000, measured 11.5 million square miles, larger than the surface of North America. Although the ozone hole has been consistently smaller since then, it neared that size again in 2015. The Antarctic ozone"

The mole may begin to enlarge, become mottled or varied in color (colors can include blue, pink, and white), or develop an irregular surface or irregular borders. Tissue invaded by melanoma may also itch, burn, or bleed easily.\u00a0 You can help with early detection by examining your skin regularly. Most of the spots, freckles, moles, and blemishes on your body are normal, but if you notice an unusual growth, discoloration, or sore that does not heal, see your physician or a dermatologist immediately. The characteristics that may signal that a skin lesion is a melanoma are illustrated in Figure 12.7. To protect yourself against skin cancer, avoid overexposure to UV radiation. People of every age, including babies and children, need to be protected from the sun."

You can gauge your progress by timing how fast you can perform the repetitions.

Training with a kettlebell\u2014an iron ball with a \u00adhandle\u2014is another type of speed loading. Kettlebell training is highly ballistic, meaning that many exercises involve fast, pendulum-type motions, extreme decelerations, and high-speed eccentric muscle contractions. Kettlebell swings require dynamic concentric muscle contractions during the upward phase of the exercise followed by high-speed eccentric contractions to control the movement when returning to the starting position. \u2022 Isokinetic exercise involves exerting force at a constant speed against an equal force exerted by a special strengthtraining machine. The isokinetic machine provides variable resistance at different points in the joint\u2019s range of motion, matching the effort applied by the individual while keeping the speed of the movement constant. Isokinetic exercises are excellent for building strength and endurance."

Another 600,000 sustain unintentional alcohol-related injuries, 700,000 are assaulted by other students who have been drinking, and close to 100,000 are victims of alcohol-related date rape or sexual assault. Binge drinkers have also been found more likely to miss classes, fall behind in schoolwork, and argue with friends. The more frequent the binges, the more problems the students encountered. Despite their experiences, fewer than 1% of the binge drinkers identify themselves as problem drinkers."

Equations can link the thickness of skinfolds at various sites to percent body fat calculations from more precise laboratory techniques. Skinfold assessment typically involves measuring the thickness of skinfolds at several different places on the body. You can sum the skinfold values as an indirect measure of body fatness. For example, if you plan to create a fitness (and dietary change) program to improve body composition, you can compare the sum of skinfold values over time as an indicator of your program\u2019s progress and of improvements in body \u00adcomposition. You can also plug your skinfold values into equations like those in Lab 6.1 that predict percent body fat. When using these \u00adequations, however, remember that they have a fairly substantial margin of error (\u00b14% if performed by a skilled technician), so don\u2019t focus too much on specific values. The sum represents only a relative measure of body fatness. Skinfolds are measured with a device called a caliper, which is a pair of spring-loaded, calibrated jaws."

Bulimia is often difficult to recognize because sufferers conceal their eating habits and usually maintain a normal weight, although they may experience weight fluctuations of 10\u201315 pounds. Although bulimia usually begins in adolescence or young adulthood, it has begun to emerge at increasingly younger (11\u201312 years) and older (40\u201360 years) ages. The average age of onset is about 20 years. A bulimic person may rapidly consume thousands of calories by binge eating; during a binge, bulimics feel as though they have lost control and cannot stop or limit how much they eat. This is followed by an attempt to get rid of the food by purging, usually by vomiting or using laxatives or diuretics. Some binge and purge only occasionally; others do so many times every day. Binges may be triggered by a major life change or other stressful event. Binge eating and purging may become a way of dealing with difficult feelings such as anger and disappointment. The binge-purge cycle of bulimia places a tremendous strain on the body and can have serious health effects, including tooth decay, esophageal damage and chronic hoarseness, menstrual irregularities, depression, liver and kidney damage, and cardiac arrhythmia."

The most frequent causes of infection and hospitalizations are norovirus and\u00a0Salmonella.\u00a0 Although pathogens are usually destroyed during cooking, the U.S. government is taking steps to bring down levels of contamination by improving national testing and surveillance. Raw meat and poultry products are now sold with safe-handling and cooking instructions, and all packaged, unpasteurized fresh fruit and vegetable juices carry warnings about potential contamination. To ensure that the U.S. food supply is safe, the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) was signed into law in 2011 to reform the food safety system. The FSMA enables the FDA to focus more on preventing food safety problems rather than on reacting to problems after they occur. Although foodborne illness outbreaks associated with foodprocessing plants make headlines, most cases of illness trace back to poor food handling in the home or in restaurants. The FDA encourages people to follow four basic food safety principles: \u2022 Clean hands, food contact surfaces, and vegetables and fruits. \u2022 Separate raw, cooked, and ready-to-eat foods while \u00adshopping, storing, and preparing foods. \u2022 Cook foods to a safe temperature. \u2022 Chill (refrigerate) perishable foods promptly."

The energy required to digest food accounts for up to an additional 10% of daily energy expenditure. The remaining 20\u201330% is expended during physical activity. Both genetics and behavior affect metabolic rate. Men, who have a higher proportion of muscle mass than women, have a higher RMR because muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat, requiring more energy to support its activities."

Solid fuels are the \u00adprimary heating source for about 6.5 million Americans. \u2022 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including \u00adformaldehyde gas, which can cause eye, nose, and throat irritation; shortness of breath; headaches; nausea; dizziness; lethargy; and, over the long term, cancer. VOCs are found in paints, lacquers, cleaning supplies, aerosols, construction materials, dry-cleaned clothing, furnishings, and office equipment.\u00a0 \u2022 Biological pollutants, including bacteria, dust mites, mold, and animal dander, which can cause allergic reactions and other health problems.

More than 100 common indoor molds have been classified as potentially hazardous to people, but only a few are serious threats to human health. One of the most common of these is Stachybotrys mold, commonly known as \u201ctoxic black mold.\u201d It is greenish black in color and appears slimy when wet.

Cheresh and his team explained that tumor cells respond to stress by converting themselves into a kind of chemotherapy-resistant stem cell.

Food is partially broken down by being chewed and mixed with saliva in the mouth. After traveling to the stomach via the esophagus, food is broken down further by stomach acids and other secretions. As food moves through the digestive tract, it is mixed by muscular contractions and broken down by chemicals. Most absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine, aided by secretions from the pancreas, gallbladder, and intestinal lining. Bacteria in the digestive tract, called gut flora, also help with digestion. The large intestine reabsorbs excess water; the remaining solid wastes are collected in the rectum and excreted through the anus."

Chronic use of MDMA may produce long-lasting, perhaps permanent, damage to the neurons that release serotonin.

Then exhale as you release your fist. Repeat. Contract and relax your right bicep. Repeat. Do the same using your left arm. Then, working from forehead to feet, contract and relax other muscles. Repeat each contraction at least once, inhaling as you tense and exhaling as you relax. To speed up the process, tense and relax more muscles at one time\u2014for example, both arms simultaneously.

The largest component of metabolism, resting metabolic rate (RMR), is the energy required to maintain vital body functions while the body is at rest, including respiration, heart rate, body temperature, and blood pressure. As shown in Figure 9.2, resting metabolism (RMR) accounts for about 65\u201370% of daily energy expenditure. The energy required to digest food accounts for up to an additional 10% of daily energy expenditure. The remaining 20\u201330% is expended during physical activity. Both genetics and behavior affect metabolic rate. Men, who have a higher proportion of muscle mass than women, have a higher RMR because muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat, requiring more energy to support its activities. Also, some individuals inherit a higher or lower RMR than others; RMR may vary by as much as 25% among same-weight individuals. A higher RMR means that a person burns more calories while at rest and can therefore take in more calories without gaining weight. A number of factors reduce metabolic rate, making weight management challenging. Low-calorie intake and weight loss reduce RMR."

Endurance training also increases the rate at which your body uses calories after your exercise session is over\u2014 burning an additional 5\u2013180 extra calories, depending on the intensity and duration of exercise. Resistance training builds muscle mass, and more muscle translates into a higher metabolic rate. Resistance training can also help you maintain your muscle mass during a period of weight reduction, helping you avoid the significant drop in RMR associated with weight loss. Regular physical activity, maintained throughout life, makes weight management easier. The sooner you establish good habits, the better. The key to success is making exercise an integral part of a lifestyle you can enjoy now and will enjoy in the future."

Most cases of cervical cancer stem from infection by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which causes genital warts and is transmitted during unprotected sex. Smoking, prior infection with the STIs herpes and chlamydia, and using oral contraceptives for five or more years may also be risk factors for cervical cancer. Recent studies show that birth control pills with less estrogen result in less or no risk for both cervical and breast cancers. Screening for the changes in cervical cells that precede \u00adcancer is done chiefly by means of the Pap test. During a pelvic exam, loose cells are scraped from the cervix and examined. If cells are abnormal but not yet cancerous\u2014a condition referred to as cervical dysplasia\u2014the Pap test is repeated at intervals. In about one-third of cases, the cellular changes progress toward malignancy. If this happens, the abnormal cells must be removed, either surgically or by destroying them with an ultracold (cryoscopic) probe or localized laser treatment. In more advanced cases, treatment may involve \u00adchemotherapy, radiation, or hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus). Because the Pap test is highly effective, all sexually active women and women over the age of 18 should be tested. The recommended schedule for testing depends on risk factors, the type of Pap test performed, and whether the Pap test is \u00adcombined with HPV testing."
